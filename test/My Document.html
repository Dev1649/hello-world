        <p>
            Computer engineering (CoE or CpE) is a branch of electrical engineering and computer science that integrates several fields of computer science and electronic engineering required to develop computer hardware and software.
            Computer engineers require training in electronic engineering, hardware-software integration, software design, and software engineering. 
            It uses the techniques and principles of electrical engineering and computer science, and can encompass areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, computer networks, computer architecture and operating systems. 
            Computer engineers are involved in many hardware and software aspects of computing, from the design of individual microcontrollers, microprocessors, personal computers, and supercomputers, to circuit design. 
            This field of engineering not only focuses on how computer systems themselves work, yet it also demands them to integrate into the larger picture.
            Robots are one of the applications of computer engineering.
